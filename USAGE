How it works:
Argument Parsing: The script checks if -p is provided as an option to include the protocol. The domain and files are processed accordingly.
Protocol Option: If -p is specified, the script includes both http:// and https:// in the results. Otherwise, it only includes the subdomains without the protocol.

Usage:
To include the protocol:

./script.sh example.com -p file1.txt file2.txt

To exclude the protocol:

./script.sh example.com file1.txt file2.txt
